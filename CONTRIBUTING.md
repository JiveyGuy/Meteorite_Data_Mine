# Contributing

### Using git

1. Always work in branches
2. Try to commit frequently whenever you make a major/minor change. 
3. Open a pull request and ask the project lead to review it before merging to `main` branch.
4. Follow the branch naming convention
5. When making a major change open an issue about it first then begin working on it.
        1. This helps us communicate and document our work and keep an open discussion about things. 

#### Branch naming

1. The format is YYYYMMDD/type_of_change/name_of_change
2. Start with a datestamp in the format `YYYYMMDD`
        1. For example `20230915` for september 15 2023
3. type_of_change is what type of change you're making. 
        1. For example `feature` `bugfix` `documentation` `refactor`
4. name_of_change is up to you just describe what it is you're doing.
5. full example `20230915/bugfix/fix_infinite_while_loop`

### Coding guidelines

1. Test test test the code when you make changes.
2. Whether you write your code descriptively or use a ton of comments make sure others can understand your code.
