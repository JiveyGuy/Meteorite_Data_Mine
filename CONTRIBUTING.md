# Contributing

### Using git

1. Always work in branches
2. Try to commit frequently whenever you make a major/minor change. 
3. Open a pull request on github and ask the project lead to review it before merging to `main` branch.
4. Follow the branch naming convention (below)
5. When making a major change open an issue on github first then begin working on it.
        1. This helps us communicate and document our work and keep an open discussion about things. 
6. The easiest way to do all of this is to use a front-end for GIT such as Visual Studio Code, github desktop, or git kraken. 
        1. It's also all doable in the command line. 

#### Branch naming

1. The format is YYYYMMDD/type_of_change/name_of_change
2. Start with a datestamp in the format `YYYYMMDD`
        1. For example `20230915` for september 15 2023
3. type_of_change is what type of change you're making. 
        1. For example `feature` `bugfix` `documentation` `refactor`
4. name_of_change is up to you just describe what it is you're doing.
5. full example `20230915/bugfix/fix_infinite_while_loop`

### Coding guidelines

1. Test test test the code when you make changes.
2. Whether you write your code descriptively or use a ton of comments make sure others can understand your code.
